						<strong>Description</strong>
						<p>Since the discovery of the double helix structure of the DNA by Crick and Watson the biomedical community has been attempting to understand the human genome and take advantage of the genetic differences between humans to adapt and develop modern treatments for complex diseases such cancer. The 13-year effort to sequence the ~3 billion bases of the first human genome has brought new perspectives to human health and our understanding of disease.</p>
						<p>Latest developments in sequencing technology, coupled with the fast rate of clinical genomics discovery, have opened doors to the pursuit of personalized medicine. However, the incorporation of genetics and personalized medicine into best-practice clinical decisions face multiple challenges.</p>
						<p>In his 2015 State of the Union Address, President Barrack Obama announced the National Precision Medicine Initiative to generate the scientific evidence needed to move the concept of precision medicine into clinical practice.</p>
						<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes — and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.&rdquo;</p>
		                                                — President Barrack Obama, January 20, 2015</blockquote>
						<p>Precision medicine in Africa in general and specifically in Morocco faces significant challenges ranging from absence of legal grounds for such groundbreaking change, lack of funding, and the lack of training in bioinformatics and genetics among medical staff. However, Morocco is a rapidly developing economy with a rapidly expanding medical infrastructure.</p>
						<p>So it is that we believe that personalized medicine initiatives loom just over the horizon for Morocco.</p>

						<strong>Symposium Outline</strong>
						<li>1. Introduction to Precision Medicine</li>
						<li>2. Applications of Precision Medicine</li>
						<li>3. Healthcare Outcomes</li>
						<li>4. Financial Advantages of Precision Medicine</li>
						<li>5. Challenges and Opportunities in Morocco</li>

						<strong>The Target Audience</strong>
						<p>The target audience includes officials, health-care professionals and providers, policy makers, researchers, and students working in the medical, biomedical, and biotechnology fields.</p>

						<strong>Objectives - Expected Outcome</strong>
						<p>The objective of this symposium is to assess the opportunity and barriers to precision medicine in Morocco, including evaluation of technical, financial, and cultural challenges on our rapidly evolving continent and to identify the strengths and potential healthcare improvements of such novel medical practices.</p>

						<strong>Speakers</strong>
						<li> <p>Pr. Peter J. Tonellato is a Senior Research Scientist and Director and founder of the Laboratory for Personalized Medicine (LPM), Department for Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Harvard University, MA, USA, and Visiting Professor, Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.</p>
							<p>Under Peter J. Tonellato leadership, the LPM develops strategies, methods, bioinformatics tools, and analyses to study and test the accuracy and clinical efficacy of genetic discoveries and accelerate their translation to practical clinical use. The LPM designs and executes insilico experiments to explore and solve barriers to translation from discovery to clinical use. Tonellato most recent work includes the creation of ‘clinical avatars’ used to simulate realistic patient populations and provide a collection of electronic medical records used to test the efficacy of genetic data, accuracy of predictive algorithms, and to conduct clinical trial simulations.</p>
							<p>Tonellato is a former Associate Professor, Department of Mathematics, Marquette University (1985-1994) and (founding) Director, Bioinformatics Research Center, Medical College of Wisconsin (1995-2004). His work at Wisconsin included the creation of the Rat Genome Database, the first disease-centric repository of phenotype and genetic data and the Program in Genomic Applications data mining system for a heterogeneous collection of phenotypes, microarray expression and genotypes. Tonellato is founder and former chairman of POINTONE Systems, LLC, the first personalized medicine Software Company to provide genetic enabled ‘best practice’ decision support system to hospitals and health care facilities. Born at the US Air Force base at Nouaceur, Morocco, Peter has a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Puget Sound, an M.S. in applied mathematics from the University of Arizona, and following study at the University of Oxford and Hiroshima University, he earned a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Arizona.</p></li>

						<li><p>Pr. Dennis Wall is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, where his lab is developing novel approaches in systems biology to decipher the molecular pathology of autism spectrum disorder and related neurological disorders.</p>
							<p>Dr. Wall received his doctorate in Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley, where he pioneered the use of fast evolving gene sequences to trace population-scale diversification across islands. Then, with a postdoctoral fellowship award from the National Science Foundation, he went on to Stanford University to address broader questions in systems biology and computational genomics, work that resulted in comprehensive functional models for both protein mutation and protein interaction.</p>
							<p>Dr. Wall has acted as science advisor to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, has developed cutting-edge approaches to cloud computing, and has received numerous awards, including an NSF postdoctoral fellowship, the Fred R. Cagle Award for Outstanding Achievement in Biology, the Vice Chancellor's Award for Research, three awards for excellence in teaching, and the Harvard Medical School Leadership award.</p></li>

						<li><p>Mr. Yassine Souilmi is a final-year research candidate at the Department of Biology, Mohamed V University, Rabat; and also a research affiliate at the Laboratory of Personalized Medicine, Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard University, where he was a Fulbright Fellow. Yassine is the co-founder of the International Society of Computational Biology’s Regional Students Group of Northern Africa (ISCB RSG-NA) and the RSG’s vice-chair for Africa and an active member of the strongAbioNet. Yassine also has teaching experience that extends from instructing at different local and international bioinformatics workshops to a TA-ship at Harvard Medical School through being in charge and teaching a module at the Mohamed V. Yassine’s research focuses on the development of high-throughput genomic data analysis workflows as well as developing breast cancer risk models for the Moroccan population.</p></li>

						<li><p>Ms. Imane Allali is a PhD student in metagenomics analysis at the Faculty of Sciences, Mohamed V University in Rabat. She is working in collaboration with the Laboratory of Genetics and Biotechnology of the University Mohammed First, Oujda and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA. In 2009, she received her master’s degree in bioinformatics at the Mohammed V University. In 2014, she joined the Microbiome Core Facility at the University of North Carolina as a research fellow under a Fulbright Fellowship. Her research aims to study the microbiome composition and the incidence of colorectal cancer in the Moroccan population.</p></li>
