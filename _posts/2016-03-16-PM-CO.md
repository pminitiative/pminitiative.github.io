<p>We are proud to announce the first Precision Medicine in Morocco: Challenges and Opportunities Symposium, co-organized with the International Society for Computational Biology Regional Student's Group of Northern Africa, Mohamed the Vth University in Rabat, and in partnership with the Moroccan Fulbright Alumni Association.</p>
<p>Precision medicine in Africa in general and specifically in Morocco faces significant challenges ranging from absence of legal grounds for such groundbreaking change, lack of funding, and the lack of training in bioinformatics and genetics among medical staff. However, Morocco is a rapidly developing economy with a rapidly expanding medical infrastructure.</p>
<p>So it is that we believe that personalized medicine initiatives loom just over the horizon for Morocco.</p>
